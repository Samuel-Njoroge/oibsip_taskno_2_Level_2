                    <p>In December 1989, he had been looking for a 'hobby' programming project that would keep him occupied during the week around Christmas
                         as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a new scripting language with a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers.
                          He chose the name "Python"meaning being  slightly in a  irreverent mood and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>
